# 📝 Hello World Part Four Tutorial

This repository contains the starter files (`starter-files`) and completed version (`completed`) of Alchemy's based, Web3Grad final course!

## ℹ️ About the course

In this course, we'll teach you how to create a full stack dApp by connecting your Hello World smart contract to a React frontend using Metamask and Web3 tools.

## 🤔 Note

Niether the `starter-files` nor `completed` have their `node_modules` folder. Before running `npm start` in your terminal to start the React project, run `npm install` to download all the package dependencies.
